# EVERFRESH
EverFresh, a full-stack web application, addresses the challenge faced by discerning diners with 
dietary restrictions such as vegans, gluten-free requirements, or those seeking organic options. 
Traditional online food delivery platforms often lack robust filtering and curation for these 
specific needs, leading to frustration and compromised dietary goals. EverFresh aims to 
streamline this process by offering a user-friendly platform tailored to the discovery and delivery 
of healthy meals. 
For users, EverFresh offers effortless discovery of health-focused restaurants, alongside robust 
filtering options and user reviews for informed decision-making. It eliminates the need to 
research menus across multiple platforms, saving time and frustration. By providing insights into 
menu options and restaurant suitability for specific diets, EverFresh promotes healthy eating 
habits and adherence to dietary restrictions. Additionally, the platform aggregates restaurants 
specializing in healthy cuisine, offering users a wider range of choices and catering to diverse 
dietary preferences. 
Restaurants partnering with EverFresh benefit from access to a targeted audience of 
health-conscious diners. This increased visibility can translate to higher order volumes and 
revenue growth as they reach a niche market actively seeking the healthy options they offer. 
Positive user reviews and a strong association with healthy dining on the EverFresh platform can 
further enhance restaurant reputation and brand recognition. 
In summary, EverFresh fills a crucial gap in the online food delivery market by offering a 
tailored solution for health-conscious diners and restaurants. With its user-friendly interface, 
robust features, and focus on promoting healthy eating habits, EverFresh is poised to make a 
significant impact in the industry, improving accessibility to nutritious meals and driving growth 
for participating establishments. 
System Representation – Design Object: Design the logical model

Report Design: 
Report 1: User Order History (Accessible by Users) 
○ Data: Lists user's past orders, including restaurant name, date, order details, and 
total amount. 
○ Users can view their order history to track spending and reorder favorite meals. 
Report 2: Restaurant Performance Report (Accessible by Restaurants & Admin) 
○ Data: Analyzes order trends, revenue generated, and customer feedback (reviews) 
for a specific restaurant or time period. 
○ This report helps restaurants understand customer preferences, optimize menus, 
and track sales performance. 
System Users: 
● Internal Users: 
○ System Administrator: The System Administrator oversees user accounts, adds 
new restaurants or menus, monitors system performance, and generates total 
earnings.

Phase 3: Project & Systems Analysis   
The overall cost of your software development project can vary depending on several factors. 
Hardware can be cloud-based with a monthly subscription or on-premise with upfront costs and 
maintenance. Software can be free (open-source) or require annual licensing fees. Labor costs 
depend on your team's location, experience, and the complexity of your project. Freelance 
developers might provide more flexibility compared to full-time employees. The Initial setup 
cost could be in the low thousands (USD). 
Resources and Team: 
● Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, budget, and communication. 
● Front-End Developers: Design and build the user interface for a seamless user 
experience. 
● Back-End Developers: Develop the server-side logic and database interaction for 
efficient data processing. 
● Database Administrator (DBA): Manages the database, ensures data integrity, and 
optimizes performance. 
● Quality Assurance (QA) Testers: Test the application for functionality and identify 
bugs. 
Phase 5: System Implementation 
Front-End Development: 
○ Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript similar framework for 
interactivity 
○ Software: Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code), version control system (e.g., 
Git) 
Back-End Development: 
○ Programming Language: PHP  
○ Database: MySQL  
○ Software: Code editor, version control system, development server (e.g., Apache) 
with PHP support. 
Additional Components: 
● Payment Gateway Integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure online transactions. 
● Platform: Cloud-based deployment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform) for scalability, 
reliability, and cost-effectiveness.( if we plan on deploying) 
Testing 
During the testing phase, various scenarios were evaluated to ensure the system's functionality, 
usability, and security. This included: 
● User Authentication: Ensuring secure login and registration processes. 
● Search and Filtering: Testing the effectiveness of search algorithms and filtering options. 
● Ordering Process: Verifying smooth order placement and payment processing. 
● Compatibility: Testing across different devices and browsers. 
In the future, we may conduct penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Bugs will be 
tracked and fixed throughout the process, including issues with: 
1. User authentication vulnerabilities.
